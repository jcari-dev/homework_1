//1. What does DRY stand for? The acronym DRY in code stands for "Don't
// Repeat Yourself". It is important to pay attention and remember it
// because, it makes suggests that we shouldn't write repetitive code 
// which is poor practice. Also, one of the tools that we have learned
// that can help us write DRY code, are functions. 


//2. What is the difference between Var, Const and Let? Const and Let are
// block-scoped, while Var isn't. Also, Const values can't be reassined, while
// Let can be. Also Let var can't be declared again, while Var can be decla-
//red again.
